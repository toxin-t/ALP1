'''
Subroutine 'add':
- Input: two integer numbers (num1, num2)
- Action: adds num1 and num2
- Output: returns the sum of num1 and num2

Subroutine 'subtract':
- Input: two integer numbers (num1, num2)
- Action: subtracts num2 from num1 (num1 - num2)
- Output: returns the result of the subtraction

Subroutine 'multiply':
- Input: two integer numbers (num1, num2)
- Action: multiplies num1 and num2
- Output: returns the product of num1 and num2

Subroutine 'divide':
- Input: two integer numbers (num1, num2)
- Action: divides num1 by num2 (num1 / num2)
- Output: returns the quotient of num1 and num2

After prompting the user to input two integer numbers and an operation choice:
- Save the inputs as variables (num1, num2, operation)
- Use a conditional statement (if/elif) to determine which subroutine to call based on the operation input
- Call the corresponding subroutine using the input numbers as arguments
- Save the result of the subroutine as a variable (result)
- Print a sentence using the result variable that describes the operation performed and the result achieved. For example: "The result of adding 5 and 3 is 8."
